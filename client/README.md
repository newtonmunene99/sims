# SIMS - Client

## Set up

1. Make sure you have followed the documentation in `server/README.md` first.
2. Don't forget to replace the `baseUrl` value in `client/src/services/constants`

## Customization

You can customize the theme by changing the values in `client/src/global/app.scss`. You can use Ionic Framework's [color generator]('https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/color-generator') to simplify this.


## Build and run

- To run during development
`npm run start`

- To build for deployment
`npm run build`
This builds the site and outputs it to the `www` directory. You can host this directory

Check out [Stencil JS documentation]('https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction') for more options on customization, setup, building and running.
